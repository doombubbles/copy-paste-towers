# Copy/Paste Towers

## NOTE: This version of the mod requires BTD6 Mod Helper >v3.0 and MelonLoader >v0.6

When you press Ctrl+C while selecting a tower you will copy it, showing you its total cost.

Then, pressing Ctrl+V will start the placement for a copy of it with the same upgrades, paying the full combined price.

Helpful for doing paragon sacrifices.
