# Copy/Paste Towers

## NOTE: This alpha version of the mod requires BTD6 Mod Helper >v3.0, see [here](https://github.com/doombubbles/BTD6-Mods#readme) for the stable mods

When you press Ctrl+C while selecting a tower you will copy it, showing you its total cost.

Then, pressing Ctrl+V will start the placement for a copy of it with the same upgrades, paying the full combined price.

Helpful for doing paragon sacrifices.
